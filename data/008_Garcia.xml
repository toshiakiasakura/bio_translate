          <p>In this longitudinal study that included 4140 children, each 4.3&#x2013;parts-per-billion decrease in nitrogen dioxide was associated with a reduction of 0.83 cases per 100 person-years in asthma incidence; each 8.1-&#x3BC;g/m<sup>3</sup> decrease in particulate matter less than 2.5 &#x3BC;m was associated with a reduction of 1.53 cases per 100 person-years in asthma incidence.

          <p>A multilevel longitudinal cohort drawn from 3 waves of the Southern California Children&#x2019;s Health Study over a period of air pollution decline. Each cohort was followed up from 4th to 12th grade (8 years): 1993-2001, 1996-2004, and 2006-2014. Final follow-up for these data was June 2014. Population-based recruitment was from public elementary schools. A total of 4140 children with no history of asthma and residing in 1 of 9 Children&#x2019;s Health Study communities at baseline were included.</p>
