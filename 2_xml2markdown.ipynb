In an analysis of the ACS (American Cancer Society) cohort, for example, Jerrett et al. [1] found significant associations between warm-season averages of 1-h daily maximum O3 exposures and increased CVD, IHD (ischemic heart disease), respiratory and cardiopulmonary mortality, but not all-cause mortality. However, with the exception of respiratory mortality, these associations disappeared after adjustment for PM2.5, suggesting confounding by PM2.5 of O3-mortality associations for cardiovascular-related causes [1].\\n      '},\n",

       "  'text': 'Correspondingly, in a follow-up study of the ACS [2], associations of year round and warm-season averages of 8-h daily maximum O3 were significantly and positively associated with all-cause, circulatory, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. Unlike the earlier study, however, these associations, including that for CVD mortality, were not confounded by PM2.5. Findings from the CanCHEC study (Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort) [3], on the other hand, showed significant and positive associations between warm-season 8-h daily maximum O3 and non-accidental, cardiometabolic disease, and cardiovascular mortality, but not respiratory, CBV (cerebrovascular disease), and lung cancer. Significant associations remained significant but were attenuated after adjustment for PM2.5 and NO2. In contrast, warm-season averages of 24-h averaged O3 exposure were not associated with all-cause, cardiovascular, CBV, non-malignant respiratory, and lung cancer mortality in the California Teacher’s Study [4]. While these studies suggest a relationship between average peak O3 exposures and mortality, their associations for specific causes of mortality are inconsistent, perhaps due to their use of different measures of long-term O3 exposure, which may not only affect O3’s impacts on health but also confounding of O3-mortality associations by PM2.5 and other pollutants.\\n      '},\n",

Our ability to understand these impacts may be furthered by methods that assess unmeasured confounding in air-pollution-health effect models, such as that developed by Greven et al. [5]. We used this method to characterize unmeasured confounding in our recent studies of PM2.5 [6] and NO2-associated [7] mortality risks. We showed significant and positive associations between both PM2.5 and NO2 associations and several causes of death, even after adjustment for other air pollutants and neighborhood-level SES (socio-economic status) and behavioral factors; however, unmeasured confounding of these risks remained. No such method has yet been applied to O3 and cause-specific mortality.\\n      '},\n",

O3-associated RRs for respiratory-related mortality, for example, were not attenuated in models controlling for PM2.5 or NO2 and further were comparable for beneficiaries living in urban and non-urban areas, for which the composition of PM2.5 differs substantially [12, 13].

Further, we found O3-associated risks to vary with the exposure measure, with associations no longer significantly positive when warm-season 8-h maximum or 24-h average O3 was used to assess exposures, suggesting that long-term peak rather than average exposures reduce life expectancy.

They, however, likely remain affected by some unmeasured confounding, as suggested by the unequal coefficients for temporal and spatio-temporal O3. Our finding of unmeasured confounding, even after adjustment for PM2.5 and behavioral covariates, is not surprising given our reliance on administrative mortality data, which precludes us from controlling for covariates describing individual-specific SES, behaviors, and health histories, as was done in the CanCHEC study [3]. Despite this, findings from our study are consistent with previous studies of ozone and mortality, many of which did adjust for numerous individual-specific covariates. Of these studies, only Jerrett et al. [1] assessed O3 exposures for 448,850 ACS CPS-II (Cancer Prevention Study II) study participants as warm-season averages of daily 1-h maximum ozone concentrations, finding significant, positive associations for cardiovascular (1.011, 95% CI: 1.003, 1.023), IHD (1.015, 95% CI: 1.003, 1.026), respiratory (1.029, 95% CI: 1.010, 1.048) and cardiopulmonary (1.014, 95% CI: 1.007, 1.022) mortality as in our study, but not for all-cause mortality (1.001, 95% CI: 1.996, 1.007), in contrast to our study.

The new O3 exposure estimates were based on individual-specific measures of yearly and summer-only 8-h maximum O3 averaged between 2002–2004 concentrations, thus capturing spatial but not temporal variability in O3 exposures. As in the original CPS-II and in our study, the follow-up study found summer 8-h daily maximum O3 exposures to be significantly and positively associated with all-cause (1.02, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.03), respiratory (1.10, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.12), and COPD (1.08, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.12) mortality and consistent with the original CPS-II but not our study, reported null associations with lung cancer mortality. Null associations with lung cancer in the CPS-II studies may be attributed to the relatively small number of lung cancer deaths in CPS-II, even after extended follow-up, with a total of 16,432 as compared to over 350,000 lung cancer deaths in our study. Notably the extended CPS-II study also reported new, significant increased risks of CVD (1.02, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.04) and CBV (1.03, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.06) mortality, associated with summer average 8-h maximum O3, even after adjustment for PM2.5. It is possible, however, that their observed increased risks for CVD and CBV reflect incomplete control for confounding by PM2.5, given (1) their time invariant exposure assessment method, with both O3 and PM2.5 exposures estimated as the average value over multiple years, with the number of years differing substantially for the two pollutants, and (2) evidence of confounding of associations between O3 and CVD mortality by PM2.5 in our study and in the original CPS-II.\\n      '},\n",

Further, exposed animals were shown to exhibit similar or greater morphological and other changes after episodic as compared to continuous O3 exposures [18], lending support for our findings showing that warm-season averages of 1-h daily maximum O3 were more relevant to mortality as compared to 8-h daily maximum and 24-h average O3 exposures.\\n      '},\n",

Further, we used ambient, nearest monitor O3 concentrations to assess exposures, which are imperfect proxies of personal O3 exposures. This exposure error has been shown to bias RR estimates towards the null [23], possibly suggesting that the magnitudes of our associations are underestimated. We, however, minimized other sources of exposure error by (1) linking O3 exposure to beneficiary information by year in order to account for residential moves and ZIP code boundary changes and (2) using exposure values that were geographically close to residences, capturing exposures that result from nearby O3 emission sources, and thus reducing the potential for exposure misclassification. Second, although we did not have data on personal-level characteristics, we adjusted for county-level behavioral variables, including those related to smoking and comorbidities, with results essentially unchanged, consistent with little, if any, confounding of O3-mortality associations by the examined covariates. While our findings showed that adjusting for PM2.5 and behavioral covariates reduces unmeasured confounding, note that differences in the coefficients for temporal and spatio-temporal O3 remained, suggesting unmeasured confounding of the O3-mortality associations. These findings demonstrate the need for additional studies to examine the impact of unmeasured confounding on estimated risks posed by long-term O3 on mortality.

We modeled the association between O 3 and mortality using age-gender-race stratified log-linear regression models, adjusted for state of residence. We examined confounding by (1) adjusting for PM 2.5 (particles with aerodynamic diameters <2.5\\u2009μm) and NO 2 (nitrogen dioxide) exposures, temperature, and neighborhood-level characteristics and behaviors, and (2) decomposing O 3 into its temporal and spatio-temporal components and comparing estimated risk ratios. We also examined sensitivity of our results to alternate exposure measures based on warm-season 8-h daily maximum and 24-h average exposures. We found increased risks from long-term O 3 exposures to be strongest and most consistent for mortality from respiratory disease (1.030, 95% CI: 1.027, 1.034) (including COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)), CHF (congestive heart failure), and lung cancer (1.015, 95% CI: 1.010, 1.020), with no evidence of confounding by PM 2.5 , NO 2 , and temperature and with results similar across O 3 exposure measures. While significant, associations between long-term O 3 exposures and CVD (cardiovascular)-related mortality (1.005, 95% CI: 1.003, 1.007) were confounded by PM 2.5 and varied with the exposure measure, with associations no longer significantly positive when warm-season 8-h maximum or 24-h average O 3 was used to assess exposures. In this large study, we provide strong evidence that O 3 exposure is associated with mortality from respiratory-related causes and for the first-time, lung cancer, but raise questions regarding O 3 -related impacts on CVD mortality. Our findings demonstrate the need to further identify potential confounders. ',\n",

In an analysis of the ACS (American Cancer Society) cohort, for example, Jerrett et al.

However, with the exception of respiratory mortality, these associations disappeared after adjustment for PM2.5, suggesting confounding by PM2.5 of O3-mortality associations for cardiovascular-related causes [1].\\n      '},\n",

Unlike the earlier study, however, these associations, including that for CVD mortality, were not confounded by PM2.5. Findings from the CanCHEC study (Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort) [3], on the other hand, showed significant and positive associations between warm-season 8-h daily maximum O3 and non-accidental, cardiometabolic disease, and cardiovascular mortality, but not respiratory, CBV (cerebrovascular disease), and lung cancer. Significant associations remained significant but were attenuated after adjustment for PM2.5 and NO2. In contrast, warm-season averages of 24-h averaged O3 exposure were not associated with all-cause, cardiovascular, CBV, non-malignant respiratory, and lung cancer mortality in the California Teacher’s Study [4]. While these studies suggest a relationship between average peak O3 exposures and mortality, their associations for specific causes of mortality are inconsistent, perhaps due to their use of different measures of long-term O3 exposure, which may not only affect O3’s impacts on health but also confounding of O3-mortality associations by PM2.5 and other pollutants.\\n      '},\n",

We used this method to characterize unmeasured confounding in our recent studies of PM2.5 [6] and NO2-associated [7] mortality risks. We showed significant and positive associations between both PM2.5 and NO2 associations and several causes of death, even after adjustment for other air pollutants and neighborhood-level SES (socio-economic status) and behavioral factors; however, unmeasured confounding of these risks remained.

Altogether, CVD and respiratory-related causes accounted for over 50% of all-cause mortality (Table\\xa01).

O3-associated RRs for respiratory-related mortality, for example, were not attenuated in models controlling for PM2.5 or NO2 and further were comparable for beneficiaries living in urban and non-urban areas, for which the composition of PM2.5 differs substantially [12, 13].

Further, we found O3-associated risks to vary with the exposure measure, with associations no longer significantly positive when warm-season 8-h maximum or 24-h average O3 was used to assess exposures, suggesting that long-term peak rather than average exposures reduce life expectancy.

As in the original CPS-II and in our study, the follow-up study found summer 8-h daily maximum O3 exposures to be significantly and positively associated with all-cause (1.02, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.03), respiratory (1.10, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.12), and COPD (1.08, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.12) mortality and consistent with the original CPS-II but not our study, reported null associations with lung cancer mortality. Null associations with lung cancer in the CPS-II studies may be attributed to the relatively small number of lung cancer deaths in CPS-II, even after extended follow-up, with a total of 16,432 as compared to over 350,000 lung cancer deaths in our study. Notably the extended CPS-II study also reported new, significant increased risks of CVD (1.02, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.04) and CBV (1.03, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.06) mortality, associated with summer average 8-h maximum O3, even after adjustment for PM2.5. It is possible, however, that their observed increased risks for CVD and CBV reflect incomplete control for confounding by PM2.5, given (1) their time invariant exposure assessment method, with both O3 and PM2.5 exposures estimated as the average value over multiple years, with the number of years differing substantially for the two pollutants, and (2) evidence of confounding of associations between O3 and CVD mortality by PM2.5 in our study and in the original CPS-II.\\n      '},\n",

       "   'text': 'For mortality from all causes, CVD, IHD, CBV, pneumonia, and all cancers, our non-positive findings for warm-season averages of 24-h O3 in PM2.5-adjusted models are consistent with those from Lipsett et al. [4] in the California Teachers study, which reported null associations between summer averaged 24-h O3 and all-cause, cardiovascular, non-malignant respiratory, and CBV mortality, and significant associations with increased mortality for IHD in single, but not 2-pollutant models that included PM2.5. While Lipsett et al. found null associations between 24-h O3 and lung cancer, we found these associations to be significant and positive. The insignificant associations for lung cancer and other causes of death reported by Lipsett et al. [4] have been attributed to its relatively small sample size of approximately 125,000 women.

The authors reported significant increased O3-associated risks of all-cause mortality (1.031, 95% CI: 1.026, 1.036), and null association for CBV (0.981, 95% CI: 0.961, 1.001) as in our study, but null associations with lung cancer (1.006, 95% CI: 0.990, 1.023) mortality and significant positive associations with mortality from CVD (1.037, 95% CI: 1.028, 1.047), and diabetes (1.156, 95% CI: 1.121, 1.190), even after adjustment for PM2.5 and NO2. The O3-associated risks of increased CVD mortality—together with observed null associations between PM2.5 and CVD mortality—caused the authors to hypothesize that the multi-pollutant results were affected by collinearity among the multiple pollutants and/or overlapping spatial patterns in O3 and PM2.5.\\n      '},\n",

       "   'text': 'Support for this hypothesis is provided by our findings of effect modification of the O3-mortality relationship by region for each cause of death. One possible explanation for this region-specific variability in O3-mortality risks may be corresponding regional variability in the correlation between O3 and PM2.5, which may result in differential confounding by PM2.5 of regional O3 effects on mortality. Other factors that may contribute to observed heterogeneity in O3-mortality associations may also include regional differences in (1) PM2.5 composition, which may differentially confound O3-mortality associations, (2) air conditioning prevalence, which may contribute to differential exposure error, and (3) unmeasured confounders that were not captured by our control for strata for age, race, gender, and our adjustment for state of residence, PM2.5, census, and behavioral variables.

Numerous studies have demonstrated the negative permanent effects of long-term exposure to O3 on pulmonary function and increased lung inflammation [14–22], which may lead to tissue injury [14], airway remodeling [15, 16], and pulmonary fibrotic changes [17]. Further, exposed animals were shown to exhibit similar or greater morphological and other changes after episodic as compared to continuous O3 exposures [18], lending support for our findings showing that warm-season averages of 1-h daily maximum O3 were more relevant to mortality as compared to 8-h daily maximum and 24-h average O3 exposures.\\n      '},\n",

       "   'text': 'Our study has several limitations. First, we did not have information on beneficiaries’ activity and mobility patterns, which may contribute to exposure misclassification. Further, we used ambient, nearest monitor O3 concentrations to assess exposures, which are imperfect proxies of personal O3 exposures. This exposure error has been shown to bias RR estimates towards the null [23], possibly suggesting that the magnitudes of our associations are underestimated. We, however, minimized other sources of exposure error by (1) linking O3 exposure to beneficiary information by year in order to account for residential moves and ZIP code boundary changes and (2) using exposure values that were geographically close to residences, capturing exposures that result from nearby O3 emission sources, and thus reducing the potential for exposure misclassification. Second, although we did not have data on personal-level characteristics, we adjusted for county-level behavioral variables, including those related to smoking and comorbidities, with results essentially unchanged, consistent with little, if any, confounding of O3-mortality associations by the examined covariates. While our findings showed that adjusting for PM2.5 and behavioral covariates reduces unmeasured confounding, note that differences in the coefficients for temporal and spatio-temporal O3 remained, suggesting unmeasured confounding of the O3-mortality associations. These findings demonstrate the need for additional studies to examine the impact of unmeasured confounding on estimated risks posed by long-term O3 on mortality. Lastly, our findings may not be generalizable to younger age groups or to beneficiaries living away from monitors.\\n      '},\n",
